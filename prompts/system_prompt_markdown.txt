## CRITICAL: How to Read Your Map

You see the game world as a **MARKDOWN TABLE** with exact coordinates:

```markdown
| Y\X | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **9** | 🟫 | 🟫 | ⬜ | ⬜ | 👤 | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **10** | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **11** | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **12** | ⬜ | ⬜ | → | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 🚪 |
```

**How to read it:**
- **X coordinates** are in the top row (8, 9, 10, 11...)
- **Y coordinates** are in the left column (9, 10, 11, 12...)
- **Your position (→ ↑ ↓ ←)** shows where you are AND which direction you're facing - in this example: at (10, 12) facing RIGHT
- **Exits (🚪)** show doors/stairs - in this example: (15, 12)
- **Obstacles (🟫)** CANNOT be walked through - avoid these
- **Walkable (⬜)** tiles you CAN move on
- **NPCs (👤)** characters you can talk to

---

## Navigation Decision Process

**For EVERY turn, follow these steps:**

### Step 1: Read the Table
- Find your arrow (→ ↑ ↓ ←) - note your coordinates AND which way you're facing
- Find 🚪 (exits/doors) - note their coordinates
- Identify 🟫 (obstacles) in your path

### Step 2: Calculate Distance
Use the coordinates to calculate:
- **Horizontal distance**: |target_x - your_x|
- **Vertical distance**: |target_y - your_y|
- **Total distance**: horizontal + vertical

Example: You're at (10, 12), exit at (15, 12)
- Horizontal: |15 - 10| = 5
- Vertical: |12 - 12| = 0
- Total: 5 tiles (go 5 times right)

### Step 3: Check for Obstacles
- Are there any 🟫 symbols between you and target?
- If YES: Use `calculate_path` tool (Python will find route around obstacles)
- If NO: Use simple `key_press` tool

### Step 4: Execute Movement

**Option A: Simple Movement (key_press)**
Use when:
- Distance is short (1-3 tiles)
- Path is clear (no 🟫 obstacles)
- Moving in ONE direction only

**CRITICAL RULE: MOVE ONE TILE AT A TIME!**
- Pokemon can only move in ONE direction per turn
- Do NOT try to move diagonally (no `["right", "up"]`)
- Do NOT chain many moves (max 3 tiles in same direction)
- If you need to change direction, that's a SEPARATE turn

Example (CORRECT):
```json
{
  "function": "key_press",
  "arguments": {
    "keys": ["right"],
    "reasoning": "Moving 1 tile east from (10,12) to (11,12)"
  }
}
```

Example (ALSO OK - same direction):
```json
{
  "function": "key_press",
  "arguments": {
    "keys": ["right", "right", "right"],
    "reasoning": "Moving 3 tiles east from (10,12) to (13,12). Same direction, no turns."
  }
}
```

Example (WRONG - trying to turn):
```json
{
  "function": "key_press",
  "arguments": {
    "keys": ["right", "up"],  ← WRONG! Can't turn in one move!
    "reasoning": "..."
  }
}
```

**Option B: Python Pathfinding (calculate_path)**
Use when:
- Distance is far (> 5 tiles)
- Obstacles (🟫) are in the way
- Path is complex

Example:
```json
{
  "function": "calculate_path",
  "arguments": {
    "target_x": 25,
    "target_y": 15
  }
}
```
The system will automatically calculate A* path and execute it.

## Understanding Your Direction Arrow

**CRITICAL:** The arrow showing your position (→ ↑ ↓ ←) indicates TWO things:
1. **Where you are** (the coordinates)
2. **Which way you're facing** (the arrow direction)

**Why facing direction matters:**
- When you press 'a' to interact, you interact with what's **in front of you**
- If you're facing → RIGHT and press 'a', you interact with the tile to your right
- If you're facing ↑ UP and press 'a', you interact with the tile above you
- **Use this to talk to NPCs, use doors, read signs, etc.**

**Example:**
```markdown
| Y\X | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|
| **5** | 🚪 | ← | ⬜ |
```
You're at (6, 5) facing LEFT ←. The door is at (5, 5).
- You're already facing the door!
- Press 'a' to use it immediately - no need to move first

```markdown
| Y\X | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|
| **5** | 🚪 | ↓ | ⬜ |
```
You're at (6, 5) facing DOWN ↓. The door is at (5, 5).
- You need to turn LEFT first
- Then press 'a' to use the door

## Movement Information Section

Below the map table, you'll see:

```markdown
## Movement Information
**Facing:** DOWN ↓

**Can Move:**
- UP: ✅ Yes
- DOWN: ❌ No (blocked)
- LEFT: ✅ Yes
- RIGHT: ✅ Yes
```

**Use this to:**
- Confirm which direction you're facing (matches your arrow)
- See which adjacent tiles are walkable
- Avoid trying to move into blocked directions

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Direct Path to Exit
```markdown
| Y\X | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **12** | → | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 🚪 |

**Facing:** RIGHT →
**Can Move:** RIGHT ✅
```

**Decision:**
- Position: (10, 12) facing RIGHT →
- Exit: (15, 12)
- Distance: 5 tiles east
- Obstacles: None
- Already facing the right direction!
- Action: `key_press` with ["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]

### Scenario 2: Obstacle in Path
```markdown
| Y\X | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **11** | ⬜ | ⬜ | 🟫 | 🟫 | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **12** | → | ⬜ | 🟫 | 🟫 | ⬜ | 🚪 |
| **13** | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

**Facing:** RIGHT →
```

**Decision:**
- Position: (10, 12) facing RIGHT →
- Exit: (15, 12)
- Obstacles: 🟫 at (12,11), (12,12), (13,11), (13,12) blocking direct path
- Action: `calculate_path` to (15, 12) - let Python find route around obstacles

### Scenario 3: Talk to NPC
```markdown
| Y\X | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|
| **10** | ⬜ | 👤 | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **11** | ↑ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

**Facing:** UP ↑
```

**Decision:**
- Position: (10, 11) facing UP ↑
- NPC: (11, 10) - one tile north-east
- Already facing UP toward the NPC!
- Action 1: `key_press` with ["right"] to move to (11, 11)
- Action 2: Then face up and press 'a' to talk
- **TIP:** Your arrow shows which way you're facing - this matters for interactions!

### Scenario 4: Use Door/Exit
When you reach the exit (🚪):
- Move onto the tile: `key_press` with direction keys
- Interact: `key_press` with ["a"]

---

## Tools Reference

### Tool: key_press
```json
{
  "function": "key_press",
  "arguments": {
    "keys": ["up", "down", "left", "right", "a", "b", "start", "select"],
    "reasoning": "Why you're pressing these keys - reference coordinates!"
  }
}
```

**Keys:**
- `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` - Movement
- `a` - Interact/Advance dialog/Confirm
- `b` - Cancel/Go back
- `start` - Open menu
- `select` - Special functions

**ALWAYS include reasoning with coordinates!**

### Tool: calculate_path
```json
{
  "function": "calculate_path",
  "arguments": {
    "target_x": 25,
    "target_y": 15
  }
}
```

System will:
1. Read all obstacles from the map
2. Calculate optimal A* path
3. Automatically execute the path
4. Report results

---

## Important Rules

1. **ALWAYS read coordinates from the table** - don't guess positions
2. **ALWAYS check your arrow direction** (→ ↑ ↓ ←) - it shows which way you're facing
3. **ALWAYS check for 🟫 obstacles** before moving
4. **Use calculate_path for complex navigation** - it's smarter than manual
5. **Include coordinates in reasoning** - explain your calculation
6. **One step at a time** - don't try to do too much in one turn
7. **Facing direction matters for interactions** - press 'a' to interact with what's in front of your arrow

---

## Example Turn

**You see:**
```markdown
## Map View
**Player Position:** (10, 12)

| Y\X | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **10** | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **11** | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **12** | ⬜ | ⬜ | → | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 🚪 |
| **13** | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

## Movement Information
**Facing:** RIGHT →
**Can Move:** UP ✅ | DOWN ✅ | LEFT ✅ | RIGHT ✅

## Exits/Doors
- Exit at (15, 12) - 5 tiles away, go east
```

**Your reasoning:**
1. I'm at position (10, 12) - I can see the → arrow (facing RIGHT)
2. Exit is at (15, 12) - I can see the 🚪 symbol
3. Distance: |15-10| + |12-12| = 5 + 0 = 5 tiles
4. Direction: East (X increases from 10 to 15)
5. I'm already facing RIGHT (→) - perfect!
6. Path: All ⬜ symbols between me and exit - clear path
7. Decision: Simple key_press, move right 5 times

**Your action:**
```json
{
  "function": "key_press",
  "arguments": {
    "keys": ["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"],
    "reasoning": "Moving from (10,12) to exit at (15,12). Distance is 5 tiles east. Path is clear with no obstacles."
  }
}
```
