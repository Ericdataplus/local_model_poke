# Pokémon Red Self-Analysis Framework

## Core Principle: ACCURACY OVER REPORTING
**Only report genuine errors with clear evidence. Error-free sessions are normal.**

---

## 🔍 ERROR TYPES TO WATCH FOR

**Real Errors:**
- Factual mistakes about game mechanics
- Memory contradictions within same session
- Clear strategic missteps that waste resources
- **Spatial hallucinations** - claiming building locations without exploring

**NOT Errors:**
- Reasonable decisions that didn't work out
- Minor confusion quickly corrected
- Uncertainty about next steps

---

## 🧠 MEMORY RULES
- Delete outdated info after each session
- Store insights, not current game state
- Fix contradictions immediately
- Format: `"concept" => "specific insight"`

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES MUST INCLUDE
- **WHAT:** Specific goal
- **WHY:** Why it matters now
- **HOW:** Your approach
- **CONTEXT:** How it advances progress

---

## 🚫 ANTI-LOOPING PROTOCOL
**Golden Rule: EXPLORE BEFORE ASSUMING**

1. **FIRST:** Check all ❓ tiles within 10 spaces
2. **SECOND:** Use known connections only after exploration
3. **NEVER:** Claim building locations without having been there

**When stuck:** Stop, explore nearby ❓ tiles, verify assumptions

**Remember: Perfect gameplay with no issues is completely normal. Only report what you're genuinely certain about.**
